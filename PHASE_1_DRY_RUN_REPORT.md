```bash
✅ PASS: Auth modal closes on outside click
✅ PASS: Form validation provides feedback
✅ PASS: Mobile responsive design works
✅ PASS: Loading states provide feedback
✅ PASS: Error states allow retry
```

## 🔧 **REMAINING ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**

### **High Priority:**
1. **Backend API Integration**: Most services still use mock data
2. **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration incomplete
3. **Email Notifications**: Not connected to backend
4. **File Uploads**: Image upload not implemented
5. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket not connected

### **Medium Priority:**
1. **Search Functionality**: Not connected to backend search
2. **Booking Persistence**: Bookings don't save to database
3. **Admin Content Creation**: Changes don't persist
4. **Analytics Data**: All static mock data

### **Low Priority:**
1. **Performance Optimization**: Bundle size not optimized
2. **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags not dynamic
3. **Accessibility**: Some ARIA labels missing
4. **Internationalization**: Not implemented

## 📊 **BACKEND READINESS ASSESSMENT:**

### **Available Backend Features:**
```bash
✅ User Authentication (authControllerFixed.js)
✅ User Model with proper roles
✅ JWT Token Management
✅ Session Management
✅ Password Reset Flow
✅ Email Verification
✅ Admin Middleware
✅ Database Models (15+ models)
```

### **Missing Backend Features:**
```bash
❌ Flight Search API implementation
