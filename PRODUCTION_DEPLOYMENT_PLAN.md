## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT RECOMMENDATION

**DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION YET**

The platform requires significant development work before it's ready for users. Focus on:

1. **Complete the missing backend APIs**
2. **Fix all frontend integration issues**
3. **Implement comprehensive testing**
4. **Add proper error handling and security**
5. **Conduct thorough end-to-end testing**

Estimated time to production readiness: **4-6 weeks** with dedicated development effort.
